# Longest Palindrome
# Find the length of the longest substring in the given string s that is the same in reverse.

# As an example, if the input was “I like racecars that go fast”, the substring (racecar) length would be 7.

# If the length of the input string is 0, the return value must be 0.

# Example:
# "a" -> 1 
# "aab" -> 2  
# "abcde" -> 1
# "zzbaabcd" -> 4
# "" -> 0
